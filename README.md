# LibraryBookListApplication
User can keep track of a list of books borrowed and can return books.

- Application will check out books and adds it to the list of checked out books. It can also return books and
removes it from the list of checked out books. Latest update includes saving the list of checked out books and 
being able to access it again.

- It will allow users to check out or return books. 

### (How to interact with my application):
- Once launching the application, it will load the information from the books.txt file and will be displayed in the 
table. After that, you can type in the title and pagecount of the book you are borrowing and press the button labelled
as "Borrow". When pressing the "Borrow" button, a sound of a doorbell will come out.
If you want to return a book, select a book item from the table and press the button labelled as "Return". 
Finally, after you have finished borrowing/returning your books, you can press the "Save" button and it will save 
what the table has stored into the books.txt file.
